I know I'm French because I:

1. prefer living in France
1. love French food
1. prefer American television to French television
1. love socialized medicine
1. no longer care that Carrefour is closed on Sundays

I know I'm still American because I:

1. find it easier to do business with Americans
1. miss unsweetened Cheerios, bagels, and spicy food
1. watch my American television in English
1. wish it weren't illegal for French doctors and dentists to advertise that they speak English
1. am not afraid to shop online
