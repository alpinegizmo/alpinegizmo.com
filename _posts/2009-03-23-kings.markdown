If you want one new show to watch now that Battlestar Galactica has ended, make it NBC's new show, Kings. I haven't been this excited by imaginative television in years. In the US you can catch it on [hulu](http://www.hulu.com/kings). The ratings weren't good, by the way, so let's all cross our fingers and hope NBC gives this show a chance to breathe. 

If you prefer to wait and watch a whole season of something at once, take a look at the first season of Damages, also on [hulu](http://www.hulu.com/damages). Both Glenn Close and Ted Danson play characters who will stop at nothing to get what they want -- and of course they are in conflict, and can't both win. Ted Danson is driven by greed and ambition; Glenn Close wants to bring justice to those ruined by Ted Danson. She's on the good side of this battle, but she's got more darkness in her than a black hole. And I've left out the appealing main character -- Glenn Close's young associate -- will she succumb and become just as twisted as her mentor?
