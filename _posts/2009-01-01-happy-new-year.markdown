title: Happy New Year!
---

I'm starting off the New Year right -- not simply with a long overdue blog posting, but a whole new blogging infrastructure. Last year I used Typo, which I've since decided is way too bloated for my simple needs. So instead I am using [jeykll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master), which transforms a [simple git repository](http://github.com/alpinegizmo/alpinegizmo.com/tree/master) into the site you see here, which is just static HTML and CSS.

If you are following the feed for my blog, I recommend you update your subscription. I did add some rudimentary RSS support to what I found in jekyll, but the [atom feed](/atom.xml) is more robust.

You may note that I've spent several hours playing with the code for this blog today, and only a few minutes writing. This may say something about which activity I enjoy more, but we'll see if I can sustain a more regular posting schedule in 2009.
