Here are several items I found truly worthwhile, but none of them are going to elicit a post's worth of commentary from me.

iTunes is one of those pieces of software with which I have a love/hate relationship. I thought maybe I was the only one who cares that its podcast support sucks, but now I know I'm not alone. Paul Kedrosky tapped into my anger when he wrote [Appleâ€™s iTunes is Mrs. Amel](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2009/12/apple_itunes_is.html).

On Christmas day Amazon's customers bought more e-books than printed books. Maybe that's not very significant, or maybe it's the beginning of a sea change. 

On a related note, Seth Godin succinctly explains that bookstores are dead in [It's not the rats you need to worry about.](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/12/its-not-the-rats-you-need-to-worry-about.html)

And while I'm on Seth Godin, he really made me think with [Fallback for the 2%](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/12/fallback-for-the-2.html), where he makes the point that no matter how clear your UI is, 2% of your users are going to screw up. So you either care enough to give them a way to recover (which can be a _lot_ of work), or you accept that these customers are lost to you, forever (which obviously sucks). 

If you are interested in what many observers would like to characterize as a battle between the iPhone and Android, you need to read [Android Or IPhone? Wrong Question](http://abovethecrowd.com/2010/01/05/android-or-iphone-wrong-question/). It does indeed appear that Android is becoming the Microsoft Windows of the smartphone market. Sigh. How do I feel about my Android phone (I have an HTC Hero)? That's a subject for another post, someday. (It's another case of love/hate.)

Another subject where I could probably go on and on, but won't, is health care reform in the US. Instead, study [this chart from National Geographic](http://blogs.ngm.com/.a/6a00e0098226918833012876674340970c-800wi) and [this clearer one from fivethirtyeight.com](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/01/healthcare-spending-and-life-expectancy.html). And then if you want to be able to laugh about the whole mess, watch this brilliant video: [If Air Travel Worked Like Health Care](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/01/if-air-travel-worked-like-health-care-.html).
