title: Kings

If you want one new show to watch now that Battlestar Galactica has ended, make it NBC's new show, Kings. I haven't been this excited by imaginative television in years. In the US you can catch it on [hulu](http://www.hulu.com/kings). The ratings weren't good, by the way, so let's all cross our fingers and hope NBC gives this show a chance to breathe. 

If you prefer to wait and watch a whole season of something at once, take a look at the first season of Damages, also on [hulu](http://www.hulu.com/damages).
