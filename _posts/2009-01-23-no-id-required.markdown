Today is a travel day for me, and I'm writing these posts while sitting in various airport terminals. First Hamburg, and now Frankfurt. What I find rather odd is that it is possible to travel within Europe without ever showing any ID. I used my credit card to get my boarding pass, and I showed the boarding pass at security and at the gate. At the gate there wasn't even a person involved, just a barcode scanner.
