title: "Rails on XML, the Series"
---

For much of 2008 my partner Larry Baltz and I were exploring how to build Ruby on Rails applications on top of
an XML database. Our client was convinced that some of their data was inherently better suited to an XML representation, and wanted to see if we could craft a productive development environment from a marriage of these technologies. The journey has been quite interesting, revealing many pitfalls and a pleasant surprise or two. Hopefully this account will save others some grief, and also point out
some interesting directions for future work.

In the series of postings to follow I will cover various aspects of this journey.
