title: Comments via disqus
---
Last night I spent a couple of hours integrating [disqus](http://disqus.com) into this site. This is a web service that implements comments. My server is still just serving up static web pages, now with a bit of javascript included. Look at the [source for this site](http://github.com/alpinegizmo/alpinegizmo.com/tree/master) if you want to see how it works on this end.

So far I'm really delighted with how this switch to jekyll + disqus has gone. I can't recommend this solution if you're not comfortable with dealing with HTML, CSS, and the command line, but if you are a programmer -- especially if you are a ruby programmer -- you may find the simplicity compelling. I am a little concerned in the long run about depending on a company with no visible business model for the comment functionality, but I guess I'm willing to take the risk. Maintaining a viable comment feature in the face of torrents of comment spam is too much work, so I'm happy to outsource the problem.
