Making pancakes on Sunday morning has been my tradition ever since I left home more than 30 years ago. I fairly quickly settled on this recipe, which I'm sure I've made more than 1000 times by now. I had the pleasure of making a batch of pancakes for our friends Jim and Claudia this morning, and Claudia's parents who are visiting from Germany. 

First mix together the dry ingredients:

    3 T sugar  
    1.5 cups of flour  
    1/2 t baking powder  
    3/4 t baking soda  
    1/2 t salt

then add the wet ingredients:

    3 T vegetable oil  
    1 egg  
    2 cups buttermilk  

Use a whisk to combine the wet and dry ingredients. Do not over work the batter. A few lumps won't matter, they will disappear during cooking.

The temperature of the pan is quite important. You want it reasonably hot, and evenly hot. A cast iron pan or gridle, or a teflon coated crepe pan works well. Pour some batter in the center of the pan, and spread it out so it's not too thick. Cook on one side until the bubbles are popping and staying open afterward, then flip over and cook on the other side (not very long). With a teflon pan no oil or fat is needed for cooking, in a cast iron pan I use a thin coating of vegetable oil. While it is often said that you should plan to throw away the first pancake, these mistakes come from either having too much oil or fat in the pan at first, or having the pan too hot or too cold. With enough experience you can avoid these mistakes.

This will make about a dozen full-sized pancakes. Stretching the recipe is a bit of an art -- doubling works well enough, but in-between quantities using 2 or 2.5 cups of flour are tricky, because you basically have to use either one egg, or two. One egg will stretch out to handle 2 cups of flour well enough -- beyond that, use 2 eggs and scale the other ingredients accordingly.
